## SmartDAO

SmartDAO is a decentralized platform that leverages blockchain technology to create a community-driven ecosystem with transparency where members can contribute to decision-making.

### `Problem`

Current centralized decision-making systems lack transparency, are susceptible to corruption, and do not fully represent the interests of the community.

### `Solution`

SmartDAO aims to solve these problems by creating a decentralized platform that leverages blockchain technology to provide transparency, trust, and inclusivity.
